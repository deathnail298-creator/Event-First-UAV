# 01 — Assumption Stress Tests

## Purpose

This document deliberately **attacks the assumptions** carried forward from Phase 0 and Phase 1.

Assumptions are treated as liabilities until proven survivable.

Phase 2 does not defend assumptions. It tries to break them.

---

## Method

Each assumption is evaluated under:

* Adverse environments
* Degraded inputs
* Human error
* Organizational friction
* Time-based decay
* Partial or uneven deployment

The goal is not realism. The goal is **exposure**.

---

## Assumption A — The Operating Environment Is "As Expected"

**Implicit belief:** Environmental conditions fall within anticipated bounds.

**Stress cases:**

* Conditions exceed modeled extremes
* Variability dominates averages
* Rare but persistent states occur
* Local conditions differ materially from regional models

**Failure exposure:**

* Performance assumptions collapse nonlinearly
* Marginal effects compound over time
* Protective margins erode silently

**Phase 2 conclusion:**

Environmental assumptions should be treated as *optimistic priors*, not guarantees.

---

## Assumption B — Partial Effectiveness Is Still Valuable

**Implicit belief:** Even incomplete performance produces net benefit.

**Stress cases:**

* Effectiveness fluctuates unpredictably
* Gains are intermittent or asymmetric
* Benefits accrue slower than secondary damage

**Failure exposure:**

* Benefits become difficult to measure
* Stakeholders lose confidence before value accrues
* Systems are judged as failures despite long-term value

**Phase 2 conclusion:**

Value perception risk may exceed technical failure risk.

---

## Assumption C — Passive or Simple Systems Are Easier to Accept

**Implicit belief:** Simplicity reduces resistance, integration burden, and oversight.

**Stress cases:**

* Review bodies demand justification regardless of simplicity
* Passive behavior is poorly understood by non-engineers
* Absence of controls creates discomfort

**Failure exposure:**

* Approval friction shifts, rather than disappears
* Documentation burden reappears in different form

**Phase 2 conclusion:**

Simplicity reduces *technical* complexity but does not eliminate *organizational* complexity.

---

## Assumption D — Failure Is Non-Catastrophic

**Implicit belief:** Failure modes are quiet, local, and ignorable.

**Stress cases:**

* Failure coincides with unrelated system stress
* Failure is misinterpreted as upstream fault
* Failure triggers inspection cascades

**Failure exposure:**

* Secondary costs dominate primary failure
* Investigation burden exceeds repair cost

**Phase 2 conclusion:**

Even benign failures can become expensive through human response.

---

## Assumption E — The System Can Be Ignored Once Deployed

**Implicit belief:** No attention is required during nominal operation.

**Stress cases:**

* Periodic audits force attention regardless of behavior
* Degradation creates ambiguous states
* Ownership boundaries are unclear

**Failure exposure:**

* Neglect becomes a liability
* Responsibility disputes arise

**Phase 2 conclusion:**

"Ignorable" systems still require ownership clarity.

---

## Assumption F — Early Analysis Reduces Downstream Risk

**Implicit belief:** Front-loaded thinking meaningfully reduces execution risk.

**Stress cases:**

* Execution context diverges from analysis assumptions
* Organizational incentives override analytical conclusions
* Late-stage changes invalidate early logic

**Failure exposure:**

* Analysis is discounted as obsolete
* Decision-makers selectively ignore inconvenient findings

**Phase 2 conclusion:**

Analysis reduces risk only if institutions respect it.

---

## Cross-Cutting Observations

* Most assumptions fail socially before they fail technically
* Organizational behavior is the dominant uncertainty
* Value realization is often slower than patience

Phase 2 should assume **hostile indifference**, not ideal adoption.

---

## Implications for Phase Discipline

* Assumptions that survive Phase 2 are *not* validated
* They are merely less fragile
* Surviving assumptions still require execution-phase verification

---

## Plain-English Summary

This document stress-tests the core assumptions behind the system by asking how they fail under bad conditions, human behavior, and organizational pressure. The goal is not to prove the idea works, but to expose where confidence is likely misplaced before execution begins.
