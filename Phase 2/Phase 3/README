Phase 3 — Execution & Commercialization
Purpose

Phase 3 defines when theory becomes execution and when use becomes commercial for the Event-First UAV architecture.

Phase 0, Phase 1, and Phase 2 are about understanding.
Phase 3 is the legal boundary where real-world use begins.

If you cross this boundary without a license, you are out of scope.

What Phase 3 Is

Phase 3 is:

Authorization to execute the Event-First UAV architecture

The commercial trigger point

The only phase that grants permission to build, test, deploy, or sell

Phase 3 is not additional technical material.
It is permission and terms.

Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0 — Permission to exist (problem framing, non-claims)

Phase 1 — Permission to test concepts in principle

Phase 2 — Permission to think (theory-only, TEL-1.0)

Phase 3 — Permission to execute and commercialize

Each phase is legally independent.

Access to earlier phases does not grant execution or commercial rights.

Definition of Execution

For this repository, execution includes any action that applies the architecture to reality, including but not limited to:

Building or prototyping hardware

Ground testing or flight testing

Simulation intended to inform implementation

Integration into an existing UAV system

Use in proposals, bids, or funded programs

Internal programs intended to lead to deployment

Field trials, demonstrations, or pilots

Creation of derivative systems intended for real-world use

Intent is irrelevant. Outcome controls.

If it affects real-world decisions or hardware, it is execution.

Commercial vs Non-Commercial Use
Non-Commercial Use (No License Required)

The following are explicitly non-commercial and permitted without a Phase 3 license:

Reading or reviewing Phase 3 materials

Internal discussion or education

Business case evaluation or budgeting

Architectural comparison to other systems

Academic or informal critique

Conceptual diagrams or summaries with no execution intent

High-level references that do not inform a build

These activities do not authorize execution.

Commercial Use (License Required)

The following are considered commercial use and require a Phase 3 Execution License:

Building, testing, or deploying a UAV based on this architecture

Using the architecture in any paid or funded program

Inclusion in proposals, grants, or contracts

Government, defense, or public-sector deployment

Offering products or services derived from this architecture

Internal R&D intended to support a commercial or operational system

Demonstrations intended to secure funding or customers

Derivative works intended for real-world application

Profit is not required to trigger commercialization.
Execution alone is sufficient.

Execution License

Any execution or commercial use requires a Phase 3 Execution License.

Base terms:

Execution license fee: $5,000 USD (one-time)

Grants permission to execute Phase 2 theory

Covers internal, government, or commercial use

Additional scope, exclusivity, or royalty terms are negotiated separately

Licenses are granted in writing only

No implied licenses exist.

What the License Buys

The execution license replaces:

Internal architectural reinvention

Event-trigger logic debates

Sensor-first vs platform-first churn

Failure-mode philosophy arguments

CONOPS deadlock

You are paying to skip architectural indecision, not to buy hardware or performance guarantees.

All execution risk remains with the licensee.

No Warranty

THE EVENT-FIRST UAV ARCHITECTURE IS PROVIDED “AS IS.”

No claims are made regarding:

performance

safety

regulatory compliance

fitness for purpose

mission success

Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE, EXECUTION, OR MISUSE OF THIS ARCHITECTURE.

Termination

This license terminates automatically upon violation.

Upon termination, all execution and commercial rights immediately cease.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 3 is the line between thinking and doing. Reading and discussion are free. Building, testing, deploying, or using this architecture in any funded or operational context requires a paid execution license. The license exists to replace months of internal architectural churn with a clear, bounded permission to move forward.
