# Phase 2 — Theory Exploration

## Scope and Legal Status

Phase 2 contains **theory-only materials**. These materials exist to explore limits, stress assumptions, surface failure extremes, and map conceptual boundaries **without authorizing execution**.

Phase 2 is **legally and functionally separate** from Phase 0 and Phase 1.

* Phase 0 / Phase 1: Permission to exist / permission to test (under their own licenses)
* **Phase 2: Permission to think — not permission to build**

All Phase 2 materials are governed by a **Theory-Only License (TEL-1.0)** that explicitly **prohibits execution** without a separate execution license defined in Phase 3.

Reading Phase 2 does not expand Phase 0 or Phase 1 rights.

## What Phase 2 Is

Phase 2 is where uncertainty is pushed *harder*, not resolved.

It exists to:

* Stress assumptions made in earlier phases
* Explore failure extremes and pathological cases
* Identify constraint violations and boundary conditions
* Compare alternate archetypes without committing to one
* Surface long-tail risks that are easy to miss during early design

Phase 2 answers questions like:

* *Under what conditions does this idea fail badly?*
* *What assumptions break first?*
* *Where are the legal, physical, or operational cliffs?*
* *What would a skeptic attack?*

It does **not** answer:

* How to build it
* How to test it
* How to simulate it for implementation
* How to deploy it

## What Phase 2 Is Not

Phase 2 is **not**:

* A design package
* A prototype definition
* An implementation guide
* A proposal-ready system
* An authorization to simulate, test, or build

Any use that crosses into execution territory requires a **separate execution license**.

## License Boundary (Important)

Phase 2 materials are governed by **Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0)**.

Key implications:

* Reading, critique, and internal discussion are allowed
* Execution of any kind is **explicitly prohibited** without a paid execution license
* Intent does not matter; outcome controls
* This license is **not open source**

See `LICENSE_TEL-1.0.md` for full terms.

## Executive Summary (Value Framing)

> **Audience:** Executives, Program Managers, Finance, Risk
>
> **Scope Rule:** This section explains *where value comes from* in time, money, and risk terms. It does **not** claim performance numbers or guarantee savings. All values are directional and comparative.

This system is **not a productivity asset**.

It is a **risk-reduction and cost-avoidance asset**.

Its value comes from preventing expensive downstream problems rather than
