# 06 — Phase Boundary Analysis

## Purpose

This document defines **when Phase 2 ends** and what legitimately follows.

It exists to prevent:

* Phase drift
* Premature execution
* Rationalized continuation after fatal findings

Phase boundaries are enforcement tools, not suggestions.

---

## Phase 2 Exit Conditions

Phase 2 is complete when:

* Core assumptions have been stress-tested
* Worst-plausible failure modes are documented
* Hard constraint violations are identified
* Comparative archetypes are understood
* Long-tail risks are acknowledged

Completion does **not** imply viability.

It implies only that ignorance has been reduced.

---

## Outcomes of Phase 2

Phase 2 produces one of three legitimate outcomes:

1. **Proceed to Phase 3**
2. **Pause Pending External Change**
3. **Terminate Concept**

No other outcomes are valid.

---

## Outcome 1 — Proceed to Phase 3

Proceeding is justified only if:

* No hard physical constraints are violated
* Legal and regulatory exposure is bounded
* Organizational ownership can be clearly assigned
* Failure extremes are politically survivable
* Long-tail risks are explicitly accepted

Proceeding does **not** mean execution begins.

It means execution may be **considered**, contingent on licensing.

---

## Outcome 2 — Pause Pending External Change

Pausing is justified if:

* Constraints exist but may relax (policy, technology, budget)
* Risks are acceptable only under future conditions
* Timing, not structure, is the limiting factor

Pausing is an active decision, not neglect.

Phase 2 materials remain valid during pause.

---

## Outcome 3 — Terminate Concept

Termination is justified if:

* Any hard constraint is violated
* Failure extremes are program-killing
* Organizational structure cannot support ownership
* Long-tail risks dominate expected value

Termination is a **successful Phase 2 outcome**.

It prevents sunk-cost escalation.

---

## What Phase 2 Cannot Authorize

Phase 2 does **not** authorize:

* Design refinement
* Prototype definition
* Simulation for implementation
* Testing or experimentation
* Funding requests

Any of the above requires Phase 3 authorization and licensing.

---

## Relationship to Phase 3

Phase 3 is the **execution gate**.

Phase 3 defines:

* What counts as execution
* Cost, scope, and timing
* Licensing terms
* Risk ownership

Phase 2 output informs Phase 3 but does not constrain it.

---

## Anti-Drift Enforcement Rules

* New mitigations introduced in Phase 2 are invalid
* Optimizations discovered in Phase 2 are out of scope
* Partial execution justified by "learning" is prohibited

If execution begins, Phase 2 has already been violated.

---

## Plain-English Summary

This document defines when Phase 2 is finished and what is allowed to happen next. Phase 2 can lead to proceeding, pausing, or killing the idea — all are valid outcomes. What it cannot do is quietly slide into execution without an explicit Phase 3 decision and license.
