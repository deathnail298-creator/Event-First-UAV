# 03 — Constraint Violations

## Purpose

This document identifies **hard constraints** that can invalidate the concept regardless of intent, optimism, or partial success.

Constraints are treated as **non-negotiable**.

Unlike risks, constraints do not improve with effort.

---

## Constraint Categories

Constraints are grouped into five classes:

1. Physical
2. Legal / Regulatory
3. Operational
4. Organizational
5. Economic

Violation of any single hard constraint is sufficient to halt execution.

---

## Physical Constraints

**Definition:** Limits imposed by physics, environment, or material reality.

**Violation patterns:**

* Environmental conditions exceed survivable bounds
* Passive behavior becomes unpredictable under edge conditions
* Interactions with surrounding systems amplify rather than damp effects

**Why this matters:**

Physical constraints do not negotiate. Marginal gains cannot compensate for absolute limits.

---

## Legal and Regulatory Constraints

**Definition:** Constraints imposed by law, policy, safety standards, or oversight bodies.

**Violation patterns:**

* Classification ambiguity triggers higher regulatory burden
* Passive systems are still subject to active oversight
* Jurisdictional overlap creates contradictory requirements

**Why this matters:**

Regulatory failure stops programs independent of technical merit.

---

## Operational Constraints

**Definition:** Constraints imposed by real-world operations, logistics, and human workflows.

**Violation patterns:**

* Maintenance or inspection burden exceeds assumptions
* Operational edge cases require attention despite nominal passivity
* Failure response procedures dominate daily operations

**Why this matters:**

Operational reality is unforgiving of conceptual neatness.

---

## Organizational Constraints

**Definition:** Constraints imposed by institutional structure, incentives, and authority boundaries.

**Violation patterns:**

* No clear owner during abnormal behavior
* Incentives punish tolerance of ambiguity
* Risk aversion overrides theoretical benefit

**Why this matters:**

Organizations enforce constraints even when individuals disagree.

---

## Economic Constraints

**Definition:** Constraints imposed by cost structure, budgeting norms, and opportunity cost.

**Violation patterns:**

* Savings are indirect or delayed beyond acceptable horizons
* Benefits accrue to different budget owners than costs
* Low unit cost still fails aggregate justification tests

**Why this matters:**

Economic constraints kill projects quietly and permanently.

---

## Compound Constraint Failure

Constraint violations often interact:

* Regulatory pressure amplifies operational burden
* Organizational ambiguity worsens economic perception
* Physical uncertainty drives legal conservatism

Compound violations are more common than single-point failures.

---

## Phase Discipline Note

This document intentionally avoids:

* Workarounds
* Mitigation strategies
* Optimization suggestions

Addressing constraint violations implies execution intent and belongs to later phases.

---

## Plain-English Summary

This document catalogs the hard limits that can stop the project cold, no matter how good the idea looks. Constraints come from physics, law, operations, organizations, and economics — and violating any one of them is enough to end execution.
