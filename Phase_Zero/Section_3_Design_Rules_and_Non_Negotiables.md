# Phase Zero — Section 3  
## Design Rules and Non-Negotiables

### Primary Design Principle

Utility emerges from **simplicity, scale, and disposability**, not sophistication.

---

### Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Stupidly Cheap**
   - Unit loss must be acceptable
   - No component may dominate cost

2. **Dumb by Design**
   - No learning systems
   - No adaptive logic
   - Deterministic behavior only

3. **Single Purpose**
   - Detect → alert → optionally image → terminate

4. **Transient Operation**
   - Short duty cycle
   - No persistence

5. **Non-Tracking**
   - No following or revisiting

6. **Redundancy Through Quantity**
   - Reliability via numbers, not ruggedization

7. **Fail Silent**
   - Failure results in silence or benign shutdown

8. **No Embedded Assumptions**
   - No assumptions about placement, spacing, or use

### Explicit Prohibitions

- Weaponization
- Energetic deployment mechanisms
- Actor identification
- Autonomous response
- Persistent surveillance
