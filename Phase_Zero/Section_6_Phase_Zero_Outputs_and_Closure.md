# Phase Zero — Section 6  
## Outputs and Phase Closure

### Phase Zero Outputs

Phase Zero produces:
- a bounded capability definition
- a clear operating concept
- non-negotiable design rules
- explicit system boundaries
- documented acceptable risks

---

### Success Criterion

Phase Zero is successful if:

> An unattended node can plausibly detect an event, notify upstream immediately, optionally capture brief context, and terminate without persistence.

---

### Closure Statement

Phase Zero for Event-First UAV is complete.

The capability is:
- clearly defined
- intentionally bounded
- ready for independent implementation

Further development is optional and external.
