# Phase Zero — Section 5  
## Risks and Acceptable Unknowns

Phase Zero intentionally accepts uncertainty.

---

### Accepted Unknowns

- sensor thresholds
- imaging quality limits
- deployment reliability
- communications success rate
- environmental variability

---

### Why This Is Acceptable

- Phase Zero establishes feasibility, not optimization
- Partial success is still success
- Failure is acceptable if benign
- Tuning belongs to later phases

---

### Risk Posture Summary

Event-First UAV trades:
- precision for speed
- robustness for disposability
- optimization for simplicity

This posture is intentional and appropriate at Phase Zero.
