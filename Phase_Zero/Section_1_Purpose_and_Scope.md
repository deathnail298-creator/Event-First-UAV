# Phase Zero — Overview

Phase Zero defines the **Event-First UAV** as a bounded capability primitive.

The purpose of Phase Zero is not to design a finished system, but to:
- clearly state what the capability is
- explicitly state what it is not
- lock in design rules and boundaries
- identify acceptable unknowns
- prepare the concept for clean handoff

Phase Zero intentionally avoids:
- optimization
- field deployment assumptions
- tactical framing
- integration decisions

Those belong to downstream organizations.
# Phase Zero — Section 1  
## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose

The purpose of Phase Zero is to define a **low-cost, unattended sensing capability** that prioritizes immediate event notification, optionally augmented by brief aerial imagery, followed by deterministic termination.

Phase Zero answers one question only:

> Is this capability plausible, bounded, and worth further investigation?

---

### Scope

Phase Zero includes:
- capability definition
- behavioral intent
- system boundaries
- design constraints
- acceptable risks and unknowns

Phase Zero explicitly excludes:
- implementation details
- deployment strategy
- environmental tuning
- operational use
- system integration

Phase Zero ends when the concept is clearly understood and ready to be handed off.
