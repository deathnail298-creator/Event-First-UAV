# Phase One — Section 5  
## Environmental Testing Matrix

### Testing Philosophy

Phase One testing is:
- bench-level
- controlled
- fast
- non-operational

---

### Test Categories

**Sensor Variability**
- low / medium / high stimulus
- single trigger behavior

**Deployment Tolerance**
- release success or silent failure

**Imaging During Motion**
- ascent speed variation
- lighting variation

**Communications Robustness**
- short burst window
- partial packet loss

---

### Explicit Exclusions

- weather
- temperature extremes
- soil interaction
- EMI / EMP
- adversarial interference

---

### Schedule

Total testing duration: approximately one week.
