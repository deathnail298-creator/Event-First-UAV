# Phase One — Section 6  
## Go / No-Go and Phase Two Handoff

### Go / No-Go Gates

Phase One proceeds if:
- event-first alert is reliable
- behaviors are deterministic
- simplicity is preserved
- unit cost trajectory remains low

Phase One halts if:
- imagery becomes mandatory
- persistence is introduced
- complexity increases to ensure reliability
- cost escalation becomes necessary

---

### Acceptable Outcomes

- partial data return
- intermittent comms
- payload failure
- crude construction

---

### Phase Two Handoff

Phase Two ownership transfers to downstream organizations.

They may:
- refine components
- harden the design
- adjust thresholds
- integrate with other systems

They assume responsibility for:
- cost growth
- schedule growth
- compliance
- deployment

---

### Closure Statement

Phase One for Event-First UAV is complete when feasibility is demonstrated and the capability is ready for independent implementation.
