# Phase One — Section 3  
## Prototype Definitions and Build Specs

### Prototype Definition

A Phase One prototype is any physical assembly that demonstrates the Event-First UAV behavior chain end-to-end at least once.

Elegance is not required. Behavior is.

---

### Required Artifacts

**Ground Node Prototype**
- dormant state
- simulated disturbance detection
- single trigger
- event burst transmission
- payload release
- termination

**Micro-UAV Payload Prototype**
- inert until released
- upward motion
- imagery during motion
- bounded operation

**Disturbance Test Rig**
- repeatable simulated input
- controllable activation

---

### Performance Requirements

Phase One does not require:
- altitude targets
- image quality guarantees
- communications range guarantees

It requires only that behaviors occur in the correct order.
