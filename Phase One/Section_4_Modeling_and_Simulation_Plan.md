# Phase One — Section 4  
## Modeling and Simulation Plan

### Purpose

Modeling in Phase One exists to confirm physical plausibility, not optimization.

---

### Modeling Scope

- order-of-magnitude power estimates
- deployment timing sanity checks
- ascent vs imaging overlap reasoning
- event packet size estimation

---

### Explicit Exclusions

- CFD
- Monte Carlo analysis
- environment-specific tuning
- adversarial modeling

---

### Completion Criterion

Modeling is complete when:
- no physical impossibility is identified
- no complex hardware is required
- bench testing can proceed with confidence
